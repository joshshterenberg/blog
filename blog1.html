							<h1 class="major">Types of Truth</h1>
							<!--<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							<p>Recently I had a conversation with Camryn about a thing that religious people do in debates with non-religious folks. It's
								usually reactionary to a scientific point that the athiest will bring up, and it's one of two things. The theist will 
								either fall for the trap and make a futile attempt to prove the existence of God(s), or make the claim that "There are
								multiple different types of truth, you know."</p>
							<p>The first option did't make for much conversation. The way I understand it, religion as an endeavor has to stem from a system
								of personal beliefs, and it's important that you recognize that that is what you're doing. It doesn't seem quite right
								to try to prove one of those beliefs, then. The second option was what we stuck with, because it always seems like I 
								hear that sentiment but I can never just *think* of other types of truth on the spot aside from scientific. What
								actually is another type of truth? Evidently it wouldn't be the same kind of thing as a scientific truth. Would that
								mean it would feel less truthy?</p>
							<p>After a while, this reminded me of a really good book I read recently: "Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid" by 
								Douglas Hofstadter. This book is really mathy (which I love), and it's primary goal is to build up an intuitive and 
								detailed description of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and it does so in a remarkably beautiful way. What this 
								conversation reminded me about, though, it its first few chapters. Before it can begin to talk about the Incompleteness
								Theorem, it began by rigorously defining a logical system, in which we can work so as to describe the Theorem.</p>
							<p>What I remembered from the book is that a logical system is a structured, methodological way of thinking that is designed 
								to produce truth. If we want to know what different kinds of truth might be out there, understanding different logical
								systems is a good place to start.</p>
							<p>Keeping things as general as possible (and taking a lot of these principles from Hofstadter), a logical system has 3 parts:
								axioms, rules, and theorems. Axioms are the starting points of the logical system. In vague terms, these are the things
								that you assert to be true, not prove, and they aren't dependent on any other truths. The easiest examples to think of 
								are math ones, like "numbers exist". But these exist in a lot of different places: "people should survive", "God exists",
								"the speed of light never changes", "major chords are happy", etc. An easy way to discover an axiom for yourself, 
								Camryn and I found, is to go through a toddler. Take any true statement you want, and then find a toddler and tell it
								to them. Odds are, they'll ask you "why?" From there, you know what to do. "Dogs are cute," "Why," "Because they 
								have big eyes and floppy ears and those are cute," "why," "...". Eventually you hit one of two things: "I don't know" or
								"Darn it kid that's just the way it is!!! Give it a rest!!!" likely followed by some huffing and puffing. If you hit
								this second condition, congrats! That's probably an axiom.</p>
							<p>Axioms are interesting because they deal with the idea of truth as a definition. The reason why an axiom represents a truth
								is trivial, literally by definition. What's interesting to me though, is that it pushes the definition into your own
								domain. What is a truth? Whatever you want. Anything at all can be an axiom for a logical system, and "belief" 
								suddenly falls out of the equation. I can begin a logical system by defining the axiom "apples are blue", and that is
								by definition a true statement in that logical system. This evolves our understanding of truth in an important way, 
								specifically because of that addendum that I now have to include: "in that logical system". </p>
							<p>Without even talking about the other two parts of a logical system, we already kind of have an answer to our intial 
								predicament. Those "other types of truths" that people mention are embedded in axioms that people choose to uphold in
								the frameworks that they are living and arguing in. This presents another type of problem though: what happens when
								two kinds of frameworks go head to head? What happens when two people that are operating in two different logical
								frameworks butt heads? Is there a "higher truth" that can bridge this larger gap?</p>
							<p>Another way to see this issue is again to connect a belief to a "truth" through logical systems. A rule of a logical system
								is a mechanism (that feels computational, which is by design) that takes as input one existing truth and generates 
								another as an output. That output that you generate is a theorem. Not a truth in and of itself, but one that required
								some argument (rule) to get to. For example: I can assert that "1 exists" as an axiom, and then define the "+" rule 
								that takes axioms to produce theorems. Then I can apply that mechanism like this: "1 + 1", and identify that result
								as it's own truth: a theorem, which I can name "2". Then I can perform "1 + 2" and keep going from there.</p>
							<p>Now let's take two existing logical systems, each with their own different axioms, rules, and theorems. By following each
								system through their rules, let's say we arrive at the *same* statement in both systems. If we plug in the truth
								value of the axioms in the first system, it says that it's true. If we do the same for the second, it says that it
								is false. This a totally understandable scenario, but how can we choose which is correct? Is the statement, above 
								it all, true or false? We need a system to JUDGE logical systems for this: a super-logical system.</p>
							<p>Does this super-logical system exist? I'm afraid to say I don't really know. We're really deep in the rabbit hole now. </p>
