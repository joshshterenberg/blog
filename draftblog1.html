              <p>A few days ago I was told that I really like a lot of different Indian-related things. And that got me thinking,
                it's probably true.</p>

              <p>First of all, I love Indian food. My favorite cuisine when I was growing up was Medeterranian, but these days I
                couldn't pick between the two. Obviously I most often eat all the basics: butter chicken, garlic naan, etc. But 
                recently I stopped at an Indian restaraunt that had a buffet going, and I got those things along with medu vada, 
                samosa chat, paneer kadai, and gobi mutter, and they were all fantastic. I'd highly recommend any of these to 
                seem less white.</p>

              <p>Second, I like Indian religion and culture. I've been academically and spiritually interested in Hinduism and
                Buddhism for at least 5 years now. My fav episode of Avatar, the Last Airbender is the guru one, and I've also
                recently read the Baghavad Gita. Great story.</p>

              <p>Third, I love Indian music and media. Some of my favorite Hindi songs are ..., and I recently watched the 
                Bollywood classic ... </p>

              <p>Finally, I love the language.</p>

              <p></p>
