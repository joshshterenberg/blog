              <p>If you didn't already know, I'm an amateur (ham) radio operator, callsign KJ5GNL. Being a licensed radio engineer and operator
                that's allowed to broadcast in public is super cool, for a ton of reasons. Firstly, I get to legally take my own voice, saying
                pretty much whatever I want to say, tattoo it on a literal lightning bolt, and then hurl that as far away from me as I can for
                anyone in the world to find and decrypt. If that isn't badass, I don't know what is. </p>
              <p>Secondly, it gives me an outlet. I did my undergrad degrees at Boston University, and they were in Computer Engineering and
                Physics. I added on the Physics one way later, so I was mostly doing engineering for my college career. Some of my favorite 
                memories from that time are at 2am in the circuits lab with my friends with some Dominos and Titos, oscillating between
                laughing our asses off and crying at our broken projects that sometimes electrocuted us. I haven't yet found that feeling
                again since, and grad school has been no help. But amateur radio let me go back to the soldering iron, and that comes close.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I get to do a lot of really fun projects. Since I've been licenced I have already built my own antennas, talked to
                the International Space Station (twice!), bounced some signals off the ionosphere, connected to weather satellites, joined 
                in on local club meets and get-togethers, learned about emergency prep and volunteer services, and most recently operated a
                full 1000 Watt (!!!) station on 20 and 40 meters [above pic].</p>
              <p>Yes, it's all certainly been a lot of fun. But I think the coolest part has been learning Morse Code. It's also been the 
                weirdest part.</p>
