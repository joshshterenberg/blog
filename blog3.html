              <p>If you didn't already know, I'm an amateur (ham) radio operator, callsign KJ5GNL. Being a licensed radio engineer and operator
                that's allowed to broadcast in public is <em>super cool</em>, for a ton of reasons. Firstly, I get to legally take my own voice, say
                pretty much whatever I want to say, tattoo it on a *literal lightning bolt*, and then hurl that as far away from me as I can, for
                anyone in the world to find and decrypt. If that isn't badass, I don't know what is. </p>
							
              <p>Secondly, it gives me an outlet. I did my undergrad degrees at Boston University, and they were in Computer Engineering and
                Physics. I added on the Physics one way later, so I was mostly doing engineering for my college career. Some of my favorite 
                memories from that time are at 2am in the circuits lab with my friends with some Dominos and Titos, oscillating between
                laughing our asses off and crying at our broken projects that sometimes electrocuted us. I haven't found that feeling
                again since, and grad school has been no help. But amateur radio let me go back to the soldering iron, and that comes close.</p>
							
              <p>Thirdly, I get to do a lot of really fun projects. Since I've been licenced I have already built my own antennas, talked to
                the International Space Station (twice!), bounced some signals off the ionosphere, connected to weather satellites, joined 
                in on local club meets and get-togethers, learned about emergency prep and volunteer services, and most recently operated a
                full 1000 Watt (!!!) station on 20 and 40 meters [above pic].</p>
							
              <p>Yes, it's all certainly been a lot of fun. But I think the coolest part has been learning Morse Code. It's also been the 
                weirdest part.</p>

	      <p>If you're unfamiliar, Morse code is the dots and dashes thing, sending messages one letter at a time, encrypting with only those 
	      	two characters (and space). It makes for very efficient (low energy/bandwidth) communication, so you can save a lot of power on
	      	data width and instead spend it on transmission; TL;DR Morse code comms can reach much farther on radio than your voice. </p>

	      <p>/.... . .-. . ... / .- -. / . -..- .- -- .--. .-.. . / ..-. --- .-. / -.-- --- ..- / ..--- / -.. . -.-. --- -.. . /</p>

	      <p>Anyway, I'm actively learning Morse code right now so I can reach farther with my little 5 Watt rig at home. What I've found so
	      	far is that there are two learning curves. The first is actually learning all the letters in the Morse alphabet and getting used
	      	to what they feel like. The second is actually getting <em>fast</em>, I'm talking 20 wpm fast. I'm halfway between these two points.</p>

	      <p>But something weird is happening. What I've found is that I'm really good at transmitting Morse code (i.e., thinking of a word or 
		sentence and then sending the corresponding Morse code out), but I'm not good at *listening* to Morse code. I can transmit at around
	      	20 wpm if I want to, but I can only really listen at 5. Here's the weird thing. Obviously I know that, because I'm so good at sending
	      	out Morse code, I've built up muscle memory. I can think the letter "L" and click ".-.." on my keyer without thinking about it.
	      	What I realized recently that I do when I'm listening is a bad habit: I end up making the hand motions of the code on my leg that I'm
		hearing, and then <em>automatically inverting the hand signals that I'm making into letters in my head</em>!!</p>

	      <p>My muscle memory works backwards? What??</p>

	      <p>As it turns out, muscle memory is a weird thing. I'm not 100% sure how it works, but I know that there are many different types of 
	      	cells in your body that can hold and store and transmit information to other parts, not just your brain. In fact, there are "brain-like"
	      	cells all around your spinal column and spanning throughout the central parts of the nervous system. Apparently, a good chunk of 
	      	motor learning is what is delegated to the spinal column. Specific chemical changes in the pathways between your nerve / brain 
	      	cells and the muscles they control are somehow created in order to make that specific line of communication easier.</p>

	      <p>Doing Morse code is somehow connecting the "letters" and the "move my fingers back and forth" parts of my brain in a chemical way.
		I'm no biologist, but the way I understand it is by efficiency of communication. If I begin with a "letter" signal in my brain, the 
		first time I map that to a specific chain of finger muscles, that communication path is really inefficient (corresponding to me
		having to think about it). Over time [repetition legitimizes], I will be able to more smoothly go from the "letter" thought to the 
		specific movements because the neuronic chain of communication will have become more efficient, and it can bypass my consciousness
		entirely.<p>

	      <p>But why is this process reversible? Why is it also possible to do the motor motion and think the corresponding letter for when I'm
	      	listening to Morse? Well I obviously can't explain it biologically, but this at least reminds me of something that happens in physics,
	      	which I do happen to be trained in. Normally when we talk about a system in physics, we can associate it with something called an
	      	"action". Action is really complicated but you can think about it like the total resistance something feels when it traverses a path.
	      	For example, a ball rolling from point A to point B could take a bunch of different paths, but some would be more efficient than others,
	      	or less resistive. A ball could roll in a straight line, or in an arc, or backwards for a bit and then forwards, etc. </p>

	      <p>What tends to happen in the universe we live in (sorry Camryn) is that things end up taking the path with the least action. The 
	      	ball rolls in a straight line, with the least resistance. This is like having already learned the muscle memory, and now the path
	      	of communication in your neurons is as efficient as it can be. But the thing about this "path of minimal action" is that it is 
	      	only state dependent. This means the most efficient way to go from A to B is also the most efficient way to go from B to A. This
	      	kinda makes sense, and so it follows for me that if I make a neuronic chain of information really efficient to go from "letter" to
	      	Morse movements, it should also make sense that the inverse process is also really efficient. The pathways have already been cleared,
	      	I just traverse them in the other direction.</p>

	      <p>I don't think this is the most efficient way to learn Morse code, but this has some profoud and philosophical implications if it's 
	      	true across the board for me. For example, something else I've noticed about myself recently is that I really like mango. Like I 
	      	<em>really</em> like mango. There's never a time where I wouldn't go for a mango smoothie from Wawa or a bag of frozen mangos from
	      	the supermarket. It just always makes me happy. I know that in my life this pathway is pretty damn clear, and that it also works
	      	both ways! If I'm happy, I want to (and usually do) eat mango. If I eat mango, I become happy. </p>

	      <p>I hope that other people have realized this sooner than me, because it seems to really open the door for "biohacking", for lack
	      	of a better term. I've always struggled with habits and vices, and straight up getting myself to do something can be a real 
	      	challenge often enough. But knowing that I can form connections from the inverse perspective, that seems powerful. I know that working
	      	out is good for me, and that it makes me feel and look good after the fact. But getting up and working out when I don't want to?
	      	Ugh. If this is true tho, I just need to recognize when I feel good about myself and my body, and *then* go work out when I don't
	      	want to! Clearing out the path from both directions at once.</p>
