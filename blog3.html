              <p>If you didn't already know, I'm an amateur (ham) radio operator, callsign KJ5GNL. Being a licensed radio engineer and operator
                that's allowed to broadcast in public is <em>super cool</em>, for a ton of reasons. Firstly, I get to legally take my own voice, say
                pretty much whatever I want to say, tattoo it on a *literal lightning bolt*, and then hurl that as far away from me as I can, for
                anyone in the world to find and decrypt. If that isn't badass, I don't know what is. </p>
							
              <p>Secondly, it gives me an outlet. I did my undergrad degrees at Boston University, and they were in Computer Engineering and
                Physics. I added on the Physics one way later, so I was mostly doing engineering for my college career. Some of my favorite 
                memories from that time are at 2am in the circuits lab with my friends with some Dominos and Titos, oscillating between
                laughing our asses off and crying at our broken projects that sometimes electrocuted us. I haven't found that feeling
                again since, and grad school has been no help. But amateur radio let me go back to the soldering iron, and that comes close.</p>
							
              <p>Thirdly, I get to do a lot of really fun projects. Since I've been licenced I have already built my own antennas, talked to
                the International Space Station (twice!), bounced some signals off the ionosphere, connected to weather satellites, joined 
                in on local club meets and get-togethers, learned about emergency prep and volunteer services, and most recently operated a
                full 1000 Watt (!!!) station on 20 and 40 meters [above pic].</p>
							
              <p>Yes, it's all certainly been a lot of fun. But I think the coolest part has been learning Morse Code. It's also been the 
                weirdest part.</p>

	      <p>If you're unfamiliar, Morse code is the dots and dashes thing, sending messages one letter at a type, encrypting with only those 
	      	two characters (and space). It makes for very efficient (low energy/bandwidth) communication, so you can save a lot of power on
	      	data width and instead spend it on transmission; Morse code comms can reach much farther on radio than your voice. </p>

	      <p>/.... . .-. . ... / .- -. / . -..- .- -- .--. .-.. . / ..-. --- .-. / -.-- --- ..- / ..--- / -.. . -.-. --- -.. . /</p>

	      <p>Anyway, I'm actively learning Morse code right now so I can reach farther with my little 5 Watt rig at home. What I've found so
	      	far is that there are two learning curves. The first is actually learning all the letters in the Morse alphabet and getting used
	      	to what they feel like. The second is actually getting <em>fast</em>, I'm talking 20 wpm fast. I'm halfway between these two points.</p>

	      <p>But something weird is happening. What I've found is that I'm really good at transmitting Morse code (i.e., thinking of a word or 
		sentence and then sending the corresponding Morse code out), but I'm not good at *listening* to Morse code. I can transmit at around
	      	20 wpm if I want to, but I can only really listen at 5. Here's the weird thing. Obviously I know that because I'm so good at sending
	      	out Morse code, I've built up muscle memory. I can think the letter "L" and click ".-.." on my keyer without thinking about it.
	      	What I realized recently that I do when I'm listening is a bad habit: I end up making the hand motions of the code on my leg that I'm
		hearing, and then <em>automatically inverting the hand signals that I'm making into letters in my head</em>!!</p>

	      <p>My muscle memory works backwards? What???</p>
