              <p>I was catching up on the news this morning and saw a 
                <a href="https://www.home.cern/news/news/physics/alice-detects-conversion-lead-gold-lhc">post</a> about 
                ALICE, one of the sub-projects at CERN. It talked about a recent update from the collaboration that they
                have directly found evidence of lead being briefly converted into gold.</p>
              
              <p>On the surface, this is not news. All you need to do to make gold from lead is to take away three protons, 
                with some spare electrons and neutrons for stability and type. All this takes is a bit of energy, and the average
                luminosity of the Swiss accelerator is more than capable of doing this. The goals of the accelerator are much more
                energy-costly, and we have moved on from such trivial atomic physics as a species, at least conceptually.</p>
              
              <p>Still, it made headlines. The old practice of alchemy attempted to do exactly this (by crude means), and proto-scientists
                were obsessed with the reaction for obvious reasons. Alchemy paved the way for chemistry and other branches of science, and
                so it's a cool tangent to the everyday drone of life to see that we've accidentally realized a millenia-old dream that faded long ago.</p>
              
              <p>My second thought, after "oh, neat", was that this news is a sobering tonic. Like all scientists across the country, I 
                have a hangover from the chaos of the Trump administration, which has positioned itself as adamantly anti-science.</p>
              
              <p>For readers in other countries, or those who may not know how the current administration affects scientists, or those
                who are not close enough to scientists' day-to-day to know, allow me to elucidate the situation with an example:
                NASA. I am not nationalistic, but it is an indisputable truth that NASA is lusted after by the rest of the world as 
                the shining star of the American enterprise. The science, media, and culture shock that NASA alone has imparted on
                the global STEM community cannot be overstated, and is in my opinion one of the most impressive things that the US 
                government has ever achieved. NASA put people on the moon. NASA launched the Hubble and JWST telescopes. NASA has put
                multiple rovers on our closest planet, and flung multiple rangers out of the entire solar system.</p>
              
              <p>NASA's budget is 0.4% of the federal budget. A famous analogy from Neil Degrasse Tyson says that, if you were to snip off a piece
                of a single dollar bill to represent this, you wouldn't even hit the paint. NASA employees, including its own Chief Scientist, are being layed off by the Department of 
                Government Efficiency to "save money". The total cost to maintain all government employees in all branches of the US government (including NASA) is about 4.3% of the 
                federal budget, which was around $290 billion in 2024. This is the maximum amount of monet that you could possibly save. </p>
              
              <p>The head of the same government department that is enacting these budget cuts currently has a net-worth of 
                $330 billion.</p>
              
              <p>Regardless, whatever miniscule financial gain the Department of Government Efficiency initially achieves as a result of these mass-layoffs is immediately counterbalanced
                by the long-term effects of firing necessary employees, weakening research and experimental institutions, and destabilizing American science. </p>
              
              <p>First of all, NASA is not just shooting up rockets. NASA funds geoscience, heliophysics, meteorology, and much more necessary elements of the modern world's day-to-day
                infrastructure. Budget cuts have immediate effects on what we know about our planet, the sun, weather systems, and more. Think storm positions, solar flares, and emergency scenarios.</p>
              
              <p>Second, the science that goes on at the level of universities, institutes, international labs, collaborations, etc. is also under fire because of their dependence on grants
                from the Departments of Energy and Defence, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and others. This has longer term ramifications. In the 1920's, the theory of General Relativity was
                being solidified. At the time, it was purely a theoretical intrigue in the circles of physicists and astronomers, with it's only application being to correct observations of 
                the precession of Mercury's perihelion. Today, all satellites in orbit require General Relativity to have accurate enough orbital dynamics for sending information to and from
                Earth, as well as not crashing into any other sattelites. The same goes for quantum mechanics and IT, thermodynamics and the refridgerator, electromagnetism and, well, electromagnetism. 
                The theoreical and abstract science of today becomes the technological and industrial backbone of tomorrow, that's how it's always been.</p>
              
              <p>Finally, a simple solution exists for scientists in America who can no longer be supported because of the actions of their government: leave. Many are considering it in my 
                circles, and some have already gone. Consider the effects of World War 2 on the global scientific endeavor. Hitler's resource restrictions of "Jewish science" made Germany--at the time a
                scientific superpower--suddenly inefficient and even dangerous. Einstein defected and became a citizen of the US, and many others followed. The 1920's were a definitive turning point
                for the leaders in technology, physics, engineering, materials science, etc. from Western Europe to the US. And look at us now, mirroring Germany in current scientific dominance, 
                and in trajectory.</p>

              <p>The reason why alchemy made headlines is not that it is new science, or that it is an important result. It made headlines because it 
                gave the public the perspective that reminds us why science is important in the first place. Seeing something like that reminds you
                of where we used to be, and says "look how far we've come". In these moments, it's important to remember why the large-scale structures
                that prop up scientific industry are there to begin with, and why their dismantlement might not be as important as saving a buck. It is 
                relevant in this context to ask what we are saving a buck <em>for</em>.</p>

              <p>Philosophically, the budget cuts are presented under the guise of efficiency. Having made my opinions on the matter clear with the 
                above rant, I now want to step back from the current politics and examine this principle as existing somewhere in the public conscience.
                What exactly is efficiency? Where does it sit in the common hierarchy of our values? Should it be there at all?</p>

              <p>Efficiency is a transitive concept, which means it requires a target. This is precicely the mechanism that is often ignored in political
                discussion, and why nearly anything can happen under the guise of efficiency. Identifying a branch of government as focused on efficiency,
                for example, can mean many things. Governments can efficiently boost the economy and efficiently support the homeless, but they can also efficiently invade other regions and
                efficiently genocide a race of their choosing. Without a target, it is a strong push towards nothing in particular.</p>
              
              <p>A defining feature of the US government as it was founded, in fact, is inefficiency. Thinking back to civics class, is the reason for all 
                the checks and balances and multi-tiered bureaucratic paperwork and appeal-abilities and revocations not exactly this, to make law-passing
                as <em>in</em>efficient as possible? With every governmental decision affecting the lives of millions, inefficiency is a tool to allow for
                the necessary pause to consider ramefecations of critical decisions. Hans-Herman Hoppe, one of the only broad-stroked supporters of 
                monarchical government over democracy that I have heard of, frequently argues that efficiency in governmental decisions is exactly what 
                makes a lone figurehead government more successful than a democracy. To this point I absolutely agree, but we differ on our metrics of 
                success. The degree to which a government functions and its societal benefit are independent variables. Take again the Nazi regime of 
                World War 2 and the Holocaust: perhaps one of the best examples of a government functioning exactly in the way that it was designed to operate: perfectly
                efficient. </p>

              <p>So there are good and bad efficiencies. And there are good and bad inefficiencies. Where does that leave us? In my opinion, the concept of 
                efficiency is one best left abandoned. Evidently a functioning government ought to be able to get things done eventually, this is not my 
                point. Spending energy on getting tasks done at all is one thing, but spending energy on modifying the efficiency of a given task that is 
                already being done is wasteful. And for the former, the problem is now pushed back to the same: how do we know what to get done at all? 
                In other words the finish line is not efficiency, it has to be something else that is valued for some other definite reason. </p>
