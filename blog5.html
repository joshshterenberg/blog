                They're running the whole show! They own everything, the whole god-damn planet. They can do whatever they want!"</em></p>

              <p>This morning I had a mini-breakdown after Camryn remonded me of that old, sobering adage: that we are all spending too much time
                on our phones. Specifically, what she said was that there are so many things wrong with the world (the government, the economy,
                the climate, pick your poison), more than enough to rage-inspire anyone with sense to get up and do something about it. Protests and
                revolts and demonstrations and boycotts are happening all the time, and a lot of them actually work, and there are always things
                you can get involved in. But we also have our phones (and TV's and video games and other stuff) that are phenomenal at distracting
                us. Her thesis was that this is by design: entertainment today has gotten so out of hand that it has completely eradicated
                boredom, and calms us down enough to never feel the need to change things. We watch a fake billionaire get killed on TV and that's
                good enough for us.</p>

              <p>Of course, that's a scary thought. Beyond just installing a screen time limiter on your phone, this suggests that you are 
                being puppeted by people with a lot of power that take advantage of you and then pacify you so they never have to stop. Someone's
                punching you in the face and then handing you a bowl of ice cream, and it's happening right now. Yikes.</p>

              <p>Well, what next? I have a screen time limiter already. How can I modify my own brain when I'm not even aware that anything's 
                wrong with it? What direction should I modify towards? How would I know that the bad feeling of changing my day-to-day life
                is actually getting towards something meaningful, or just making my life worse for no reason?</p>

              <p>Truthfully, I have no idea. The remainder of this article is my best attempt at an answer.</p>

              <p>For starters, if I really am being drugged to the point that I can't even realize how much I'm getting screwed, it seems like
                the first logical step is to gain clarity of my situation. Here, you can kill two birds with one stone. For starters, there's
                nothing wrong with a screen time blocker; but limit your consumption of media in ALL FORMS. There's a trendy photo of people
                sitting on a train silently reading the paper, with the caption "all this technology is making us antisocial". People have always
                had the problem that we feel today with social media, just in different forms. Phones, TV, newspapers, video games, radio, movies,
                music, sports, if we're trying to get to the root of the problem we have to recognize just how much entertainment we have under
                our noses in all forms, and get rid of it. </p>

              <p>You'll find that the second you drop all of these vices that you'll be reacquainted with an old
                friend. He'll be a little fuzzy at first, you might not recognize him, sitting quietly in a small dusty corner of your mind that you
                forgot was there. After a while you'll finally see him for who he is, and after a bit longer you'll remember why you cut ties with
                him. So damn annoying, and weirdly uncomfortable, nearly to the point of pain. I think I'd personally rather be in pain than be in his
                presence for too long. But if we're doing this, then he's a necessary, stupid interlude in our journey. Welcome back boredom, make yourself 
                at home.</p>

              <p>The first bird is getting rid of the pacifier you've been suckin on. The second, of course, is replacing it with real food. 
                This step has been a bit harder for me. One of the successes of social media is that it works by Pavloving your amygdala, constantly
                baiting your feelings in a destructive loop. Not making you happy, but making you *just* happy enough to keep scrolling. This
                way, you never need a goal because you're not getting anywhere, the goal is to be satisfied with your scrolling, which you never
                will be. Replacing this and kicking out your bad friend at the same time is tough because doing something usually involves having a goal.
                Here's where I think we can do something useful. Instead of making a random goal like read more or play more sports or spend more
                time with your kids (ew), we can get to the root of the problem. Remember, we're limiting social media to gain clarity into our
                situation; seeing how badly we're being bent over by given people, groups, institutions, whatever.</p>

              <p>Replace entertaining yourself with setting a baseline: learning about the rest of the world. This is what I'm gonna try to do 
                this coming week (hopefully weeks): dedicate the time that I'd usually be scrolling away or watching a movie or playing video
                games to doing a cultural deep dive into one location, one economic system, one philosophy, whatever. I'll document my process
                here and try to make that next week's post. This way, I have a definite goal: to have gained literacy in one specific thing,
                keeping track of it gamifies the experience, I can deep dive into whatever I'm interested in so it doesn't feel like a chore,
                and at the end of the week I'll have added a bit to my mental collection!</p>

              <p>How would this solve our problem? I'll give you an example. Right now, I'd consider myself modestly left-leaning in American 
                politics (see my last post). I generally find myself agreeing with
                Democratic candidates on issues of the personal, the economic, foreign affairs, ideology, etc. Maybe I'll also bring up my 
                opinions on prisons in the future, because that's my most left-leaning belief. In any case, I found out recently by talking to
                many European people at my work that they consider me <em>center right</em>. As it turns out, my scale is skewed because of the
                country I live in, the people I interact with daily, but also because I don't know how I actually measure up to people in other
                parts of the world.</p>

              <p>I want to change that. I want to know how left I lean by learning about Italian liberalism. I want to know how bad
                my taxes are by comparing them to my income level in Eswatini. I want to know how much I'm actually helping towards climate
                change by understanding energy protests in China. I think that the only way I can actually realize what my current position is is by
                aggreggating as much information as I can about how people live in the rest of the world, and seeing how I compare. I want to 
                "de-skew" as many of my scales as I can.</p>

              <p>I don't think I'm going to completely quit watching YouTube or playing video games, and I also don't think I'm gonna get to
                Malala levels of inter-cultural literacy about a cause. But the hardest lesson for someone like me to remember is that *some*
                progress is better than none. Doing 10% of a task, especially one as important as this, is better than what I'm doing now.</p>

              <p>I'll see you next week to find out how I did.</p>
