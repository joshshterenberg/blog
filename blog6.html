                "Meet me in the middle," says the unjust man.</em></p>

              <p>Sorry that it's been a few weeks. I guess I should start with an update from my last post then, as I am a man of my word. I did end up 
                trying out that social media detox (which for me is just YouTube), and replacing it with learning about a country. I chose India because
                I like a lot of different aspects of its culture, and I did learn a lot. After a few days, I went back into my old patterns. Turns out that
                this social media grip is a lot stronger than I thought it would be.</p>

              <p>I partially slipped back into my old habits because I didn't put in the continual work not to do so; it didn't feel like the ends
                justified the means anymore. I also partially slipped back because I let myself. You see, a week after my last post was my birthday, 
                which was really fun and exciting and enjoyable. I got to spend time around people I
                cared about, and I took a well-deserved break from the dragging-on of everyday life, which I loved. But that was a week ago.</p>

              <p>And it's been a long second week.</p>

              <p>For starters, every time I open a news feed I sink a little deeper into my chair. I need not rant any more than I already have, but it's no
                longer news that the democratic underscore of our government is not just teeter-totering. A reliable indicator of how your money is being
                spent today is the current mood of the President of the United States. Governmental organizations and jobs are faltering because of fads and 
                trends. Bribery is at the forefront of international politics, at least when it's not overwhelmed by the yottabytes of digitized political 
                flatulence designed to anger, taunt, and mainly distract.</p>

              <p>Meanings of words are changing. The words that represent the values of this government do not mean what they once meant. And theorists have a 
                phenomenal word to describe this process.</p>

              <p>My work has been stagnant lately. My advisor has been on leave for 2 weeks, and so we haven't been communicating about me or my project lately.
                I've been upkeeping the latest set of updates, but I can't really see a way forward at the moment. Normally the way this works is my advisor and
                I meet up, I tell him everything I did that week, he tells me all the problems he sees with what I did and what needs to be done next, I do those.
                We meet the following week, and the cycle continues. But right now I have a set of results, actual research results that I believe in, and I'm 
                essentially just waiting for his critiques. If it was up to me, I'd already be drafting a paper, but I don't want to do that in vain if he sees
                something major that I don't.</p>

              <p>In any case, a lot of my time has been spent on other tasks. I get chores done, make phone calls, send emails, submit applications, work on 
                projects. I think a lot about where I am and what I'm doing. I've realized recently that the process has begun for me.</p>

              <p>It always starts slow, some fleeting thought in the back of my mind that I pay no heed to. But eventually, I know I'll start entertaining it
                and seeing where it leads. My career up to this point has been scattered, no better word for it. And I don't see anything changing in the
                future, because my vision for my own life keeps changing. I treat my career the same way I treat my hobbies and general interests, just at 
                a much larger scale.</p>

              <p>I was into crochet for a while. It occupied a lot of my time and I'm proud of the things I've made. But eventually I started spending less 
                personal time on it, making it less of a priority in my life. I didn't believe in the value of the work enough to merit the effort, which was
                generally obsessive and destructive. I did it less and less, and eventually not at all. Now I don't want to do it anymore. It's not fun, not
                interesting, and I've got way cooler things on my plate. This process happens with all my hobbies, and it'd happened with my career too. The 
                time scale is much larger, but I can feel the edges peeling. The frame rusting. The colors fading. It's ever-so-small, just a fleeting thought.
                It seems like there's a good word I could use to describe this.</p>

              <p>Things aren't so good with my partner at the moment. She said that she felt distant from me, like we're behaving more like roommates than
                partners. She was on the verge of tears when I left her for work today, confused and stirred and a bit afraid. I was all of those things too,
                but I lied and pretended that everything was fine the way I saw things. I don't know why.</p>

              <p>It's very easy for me to get insecure, and I'm sure my current habits aren't helping. Lately I drink a lot, I don't exercise, I'm on my 
                phone too much, the apartment is messy. But mostly, I'm getting comfortable. Either that, or I'm genuinely just not being a good person to
                her, and trying to hide and guilt her out of realizing that.</p>

              <p>The thing that spawned our fight was me being shocked at her going in to kiss me, and not good shocked. I got concerned and I asked her if 
                she was feeling ok, like an idiot. I think it was genuinely just a mistake sentence at the time, and I didn't mean anything by it, which is
                definitely why I kept playing the "I think everyhing is ok" card. She deserved better than that, though.</p>

              <p>We also agreed that this morning was just the tipping point of a building problem. We aren't doing as much for each other. We're caring 
                less and communicating less. Whatever we were a week ago isn't where we are today. Feels like a great use of a very particular word.</p>

              <p>Backsliding. It feels like every aspect of my life is backsliding. To be honest, I don't have a clear way forward. But I have something of a hazey vision. </p>

              <p>As I'm writing this, I was just interrupted by a 
                friend and colleague of mine; I'm writing in a common space and he came in for coffee. We spoke about our research plans, and I mentioned
                my current position and that I feel stagnant. He told me that, because I already have some rough plot ideas, I could start drafting the 
                intro and methodology sections of the paper. Those aren't likely to change too much even if my results do, so that's a way to make a bit of
                progress while I'm waiting for my advisor to come back.</p>

              <p>And politically, what can I do? I think that reflects off my last post: I just need to get the hell off the internet so much. Oftentimes 
                problems seem much larger through the eyes of someone literally capitalizing off of your attention. Avoiding the slop, and replacing that
                with things I like to do, as I have been, is a step in the right direction. I've been watching youtube videos on TVC for rocketry, building
                PCB designs for some radio-related passion projects, and I just finished a Metal Earth model of Voyager I.</p>

              <p>My partner deserves my communication, but more importantly my honesty. I want to tell her how things feel and why I did what I did and how
                much of a loser I am for supressing feelings to try to force things to feel normal instead of being vulnerable. It's hard, but I want to make
                the steps to fix this too. I'll buy her flowers.</p>

              <p>Backsliding might not be something that has an obvious solution, if any exists. Sometimes it happens so slowly that when you notice it you're
                already waist-deep in something you really shouldn't be. And I don't have a catch-all except for the thing nobody wants to hear: it takes work.
                But the thing that people ALWAYS leave off is that it doesn't take a lot of work, just a tiny bit more than you're doing right now! I can stop
                drinking, start exercising, get off my phone, have more fun with my hobbies, go for walks, let more light in, communicate more, smile more, and
                it would not be that hard. I just need to get it off the ground.</p>
              
              <p>I'm gonna publish this and go try those things right now. Maybe things will start sliding a bit slower.</p>
