							<!--<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							<p>In today’s blog post, I will review two books I have recently read, comparing their narratives and themes and reflecting on 
								the broader insights they provide to readers about poverty in America. Hillbilly Elegy and I Survived Capitalism and 
								All I Got was This Lousy T-Shirt are two memoirs which both examine the authors’ respective experiences growing up in 
								poor, working class areas of the United States. In Hillbilly Elegy, author and US Vice President J.D. Vance recounts 
								memories of his unstable and often tumultuous upbringing in Middletown, Ohio- a small, rural, poverty-stricken town in 
								Appalachia. Vance describes his upward climb from generational struggle to professional and financial stability, 
								eventually graduating from Yale Law School and working as a venture capitalist. Through his personal account, Vance 
								explores complex dynamics of social class, culture, and family while contemplating the broader economic and cultural 
								issues facing working-class America. Madeline Pendleton, author of I Survived Capitalism, also experienced generational 
								poverty, yet her story is one of urban poverty. The memoir narrates Pendleton’s financial journey as she navigates 
								survival within the system of capitalism. Readers follow Pendleton from frequent encounters with homelessness during 
								her youth in Fresno, California to founding a successful clothing company that prides itself on ethical business 
								practices and workplace community. Throughout this narrative, she provides the reader with fifteen “capitalism 
								survival skills,” each one a lesson in practical financial guidance rooted in her own lived experience.</p>

							<p>While Pendleton and Vance each acknowledge the struggles and economic hardships their communities endure, with both describing 
								individuals in their communities often struggling to find consistent work and feed their families, they reach entirely 
								divergent conclusions regarding the root of this poverty and the most effective approaches to combating it. Pendleton 
								holds the system of capitalism responsible for depriving her community, and the working class as a whole, of the resources 
								and opportunities they need in order to make financial stability a feasible reality. Although Vance admits that many of 
								the people he knew growing up were honest and hardworking, he argues that cultural issues and lack of personal responsibility, 
								rather than systemic economic inequities, appear to be the fueling forces behind the cycles of poverty that pervaded his 
								town and others like it in the region. </p>

							<p>Comparisons between these authors’ definitions and measurements of success further elucidate their contrasting mindsets regarding 
								poverty in their early lives. In both memoirs, Vance and Pendleton express desires to work towards achieving financial 
								stability by leaving the city or region in which they were raised. As Pendleton puts it, most people living in these poor 
								cities and towns viewed “making it out” as the only way to give themselves a chance at economic success. At certain points in 
								their lives, both authors also considered a college education to be a potential one-way ticket out of their opportunity-scarce 
								hometowns and into upward class mobility. Vance applied to two colleges, and in his memoir, he recalls memories of attempting 
								to parse his college options with his grandmother, Mamaw, and realizing that in spite of the scholarships and pell grants he 
								received due to the family’s low income status, going to Ohio State would obligate him to incur thousands of dollars in debt. 
								His aversion to debt, combined with an impression that he was entirely unprepared for college and a sense of duty to serve his 
								country following 9/11, led Vance to enlist in the US Marines rather than attending university immediately after graduating 
								high school. In I Survived Capitalism, Pendleton also reflects on her encounters with the military, yet she portrays them as 
								predatory toward poor communities and expresses political disapproval of their recruitment practices. “The US military did 
								its best to convince me that they were my only hope,” she writes. Though she acknowledges that private universities also 
								target low-income students with limited options and experience, she decides to attend college to study fashion design. 
								Viewing college as her only realistic path to upward mobility, she felt compelled to take on the thousands of dollars of 
								additional debt necessary to attend, even with the scholarships she receives due to her high grades, strong test scores, 
								and low-income status. Due to their shared experiences growing up in economic hardship, both Vance and Pendleton find 
								themselves navigating similar decisions about whether to pursue college, military service, or another path as potential 
								means of escape. Nevertheless, the way they interpret and respond to these choices reflects the deep ideological divide 
								between them: Vance ultimately views military service and personal discipline as ideal routes to redemption and success, 
								while Pendleton critiques the very systems—education, the military, and capitalism itself—that claim to offer salvation but, 
								in reality, often exploit the poor under the guise of opportunity. Although Vance frames his convictions through the lens of 
								his own personal experience, his disdain for the dependency mindset of some members of his community indicate his belief that 
								the patriotism and discipline that the Marines ingrained in him are values from which the people of Appalachia could stand to 
								benefit.</p>

							<p>The authors’ attitudes towards work and employment also demonstrate their distinct convictions regarding their communities’ 
								relationships to poverty. Chapter 3 of I Survived Capitalism chronicles Pendleton’s struggle to secure employment that offered 
								a livable wage after moving to Santa Cruz. Pendleton obtains a minimum-wage job working customer service in a photo lab. 
								Struggling to survive on her low salary, Pendleton becomes determined to work hard enough to earn a raise, memorizing training 
								documents, perfecting her customer service skills, and consistently going above and beyond in hopes that her employer would 
								reward her industriousness. Concerned that the company would claim to be unable to afford to increase her wages, she created 
								a new and more efficient shipping system that would allow them to save over $200,000 per year. Upon presenting the plan to 
								her employer and inquiring about the possibility of raising her salary, she is met with congratulatory remarks and praise 
								for her “excellent work,” yet her bosses refuse to directly answer her salary increase request. A jaded coworker later 
								cautions her that the company will never pay her more than they need to. “They’re going to be happy you’re doing all that 
								extra work for free so they don’t have to hire someone else to do it,” he remarks. “The key to getting by in this place is 
								to just act really, really stupid.”</p>

							<p>The cynical attitude of Pendleton’s coworker toward work reflects the very outlook that J.D. Vance criticizes in Hillbilly Elegy. 
								In recounting a time in which he briefly worked at a tile warehouse, Vance expresses grievances with the irresponsible habits 
								of some of his co-workers who frequently arrived late or took long bathroom breaks on the job, asserting that “too many young 
								men are immune to hard work.”  He provides a specific example of a nineteen-year-old co-worker with a pregnant girlfriend who 
								“carelessly tossed aside a good job” due to his unwillingness to develop a disciplined work ethic. Yet Pendleton’s experience 
								invites readers to question what qualifies as a “good job.” Her memoir reveals that even jobs with benefits and stability can 
								be exploitative, especially when upward mobility is blocked and workers are treated as expendable. Moreover, even with a truly 
								“good” job- one with higher wages, more benefits, and more opportunities for upward growth than the average job, employees at 
								most companies are still unjustly exploited for their labor by their employers. Most business owners operate under a 
								profit-driven framework which incentivizes them to compensate workers less than the actual value of their labor in order to 
								maximize profits. This undercompensation of labor can, in turn, diminish an employees’ motivation to be as diligent workers 
								as they otherwise could be. But more importantly, the systemic failure of companies to pay their employees a livable wage 
								perpetuates the cycle of poverty as workers in many of these minimum wage jobs do not have the opportunity to establish 
								financial stability for themselves and can scarcely scrape by with each paycheck they receive. By limiting his critique to 
								social decay, laziness, and over-reliance of government assistance within his community, Vance fails to address some of the 
								more fundamental underlying concerns that create and sustain poverty in America. </p>
